## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, you can message us in the #general channel on the [Tonk Discord](https://discord.gg/usRBwU5rpN). 

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. 

- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [Issues](/issues).
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?
We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) using the "bug template". (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.) 

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for CONTRIBUTING.md, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.


#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- At this stage of the project, idea generation is a good thing not a bad thing, so feel free to throw out whatever kind of wacky ideas you have. These will be prioritized by the maintaining team with labels, but there's no such thing as a "bad idea" even if we decide it's out of scope for the project long term.

### How to Contribute
Most kits logically should be git submodules. This just makes everything easier to manage. 

#### Major contributions 
mainly include the addition of a new tooling paradigm. Let's say you want to experiment with a fun new tool and don't see something available here. Well, you're going to have to go through all the frustration of setting up the project structure anyway. Why not make it a contribution to the kits?

or perhaps you see that the stock example for your favorite `insert tooling of choice` isn't exactly right. Certainly it would be much easier if just things were done X way instead of Y way. Well, now's your chance to submit that PR.

#### Minor contributions 
would include updating or amending one of the current kits. Let's say you pull down a kit and you can't wait to go. You run any setup scripts or try to compile and realize it's broken. Well, you're going to fix it anyway! Why not make it a contribution to this kit?
