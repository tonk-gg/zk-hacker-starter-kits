# zk-hacker-starter-kits
A curated set of starter kits for getting on with your zk (and other cryptography too) projects

### Why?

 The ecosystem is missing a curated template repo (like a zk hacker playground) that comes preconfigured for all the best tools with zk powers (e.g. zkDSLs, semaphore, etc) + helpers, libraries and templates for other common cryptographic operations/schemes to get hackers rolling. 

1. Setting up project boilerplate and glue code is always this tedious process and if you could just have that done already, that's more time spent thinking about your application. 
2. Tooling landscape changing so quickly documentation is slightly out of date, example repos are way out of date and combining disparate tooling into one project structure can be a pain.
3. Typically I find code to be more instructive than documentation for getting started. All I need is the right framing and then filling in the details becomes a relatively straightforward task.
